Adding CRUD operations POST
Edits in index.js in db folder:
- commented out Stephen's mongodb connection on lines 7-11 in index.js in db folder
- wrote new function called makeNewGameOverview that saves newGame info
- Oops, Stephen already had a POST function named 'save'
- Commented out my code, using Stephen's save function


- Adding CRUD Operations Delete, Put
- db function called 'updateGameOverview' for PUT
- db function called 'deleteGameOverview' for DELETE
