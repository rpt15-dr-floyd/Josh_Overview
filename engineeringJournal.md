Adding CRUD operations POST
Edits in index.js in db folder:
- commented out Stephen's mongodb connection on lines 7-11 in index.js in db folder
- wrote new function called makeNewGameOverview that saves newGame info
- Oops, Stephen already had a POST function named 'save'
- Commented out my code, using Stephen's save function


- Adding CRUD Operations Delete, Put
- db function called 'updateGameOverview' for PUT
- db function called 'deleteGameOverview' for DELETE


Edits in index.js in server folder:
- added CRUD OPERATIONs Delete, Put, Post
- Tested with Postman
- Works!

- Can't get sql to work
- Set up OH to fix sql 
- Decided it was a problem my bash_profile and that was affecting mysql command path

- My bash_profile file doesn't seem to be working? Can't use any commands now
- Now instead of just mysql command not working...no command will work...vim, cat, ls, cd...
- Terminal broken ): wat do
- Can't commit because vim command won't work
